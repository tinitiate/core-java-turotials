 * > TOPIC : JAVA Communication
 * 
 * > NOTES : 1) Java provides mechanisms for threads to communicate with each other, this is
 *              useful where there are parent-child threads, event-based operations with threads.
 *           2) The major hurdle is to avoid polling in inter-thread communication.
 *           3) wait(): This method tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and
 *                      go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify().
 *           4) notify(): This method wakes up the first thread that called wait() on the same object.
 *           5) notifyAll(): This method wakes up all the threads that called wait()
 *                           on the same object. The highest priority thread will run first.
